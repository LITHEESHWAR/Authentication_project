#Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Project

#Project Overview:
    This project demonstrates a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) protocol that manages user access and permissions within an application. The system includes           functionalities for both users and admins, such as user registration, login, and logout. The application restricts access to certain features based on the          user's role. For instance, when a user clicks the "admin_access" button, a popup appears with an "access denied" message. However, when an admin clicks the         same button,they are navigated to a dedicated admin page with full access to the application.
    

#Features:
    *1. User Authentication
      Secure user registration, login, and logout functionalities.
      Passwords are hashed using bcrypt for enhanced security.
      JWT (JSON Web Token) is used for managing secure sessions.
    *2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
      Differentiates user permissions based on assigned roles.
      Ensures that only users with the admin role can access certain parts of the application.
      Prevents unauthorized access through role verification.
    *3. Secure Session Management
      User sessions are securely managed using JWT, which is included in HTTP headers to confirm user identity.
    *4. RBAC Implementation
      The application distinguishes between user roles (e.g., regular users and admin users).
      Admin users have full rights to access and modify application data, while regular users have limited access.

      
#Project Structure
    *server.js: The main server file that handles the server logic, routes, and middleware.
    *.env: Contains environment variables and database connectivity credentials (e.g., database host, user, password).
    *index.html: The frontend file for user registration and login forms.
    *admin.html: The page that users are redirected to if they are admin users, providing full access to the admin functionalities.
    *app.js: Contains JavaScript code for handling frontend events and client-side interactions.

#Role-Based Access Control Details
    *Roles:
        Admin: Has unrestricted access to all application features, including the ability to view and manage user data.
        User: Has limited access to the application, with restrictions on accessing admin-only features.
    *Permissions:
        Admin: Can navigate to the admin page and perform administrative functions.
        User: Can use the application but cannot access the admin page; clicking the "admin_access" button results in an "access denied" popup.

#Technologies Used
    *Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
    *Database: MySQL
    *Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token)
    *Security: bcrypt for password hashing
    *Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
